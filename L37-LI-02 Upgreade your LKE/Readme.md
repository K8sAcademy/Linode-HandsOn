Let's upgrade a cluster.

## Cloud Manager

Create a new cluster this time, selecting the older version available.

Once created, you should see a message saying that a new version of Kubernetes is available.

Click on the **Upgrade Version** button.

In step 1, click on the **Upgrade Version** button.

In step 2, click on the **Recycle All Nodes** button.

Linode will recycle one node at a time.  The process can take some time to complete.

## Cleanup

Wait for all node to be recycled and delete the cluster.
